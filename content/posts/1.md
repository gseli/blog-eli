I want to touch your face
I don't care what the world says
It's been a dream of mine
A dream within a dream
To be able to see you while awake

I want to look at your skin
I want to hold your hands
I want to talk to you about things all night
About dreams
About rainbows
About the sky and the moon and the stars

Come find me
Come find me
Come find me

Now it's your turn
I've been looking for you for the longest of times
But now I want you to find me
You have to look for me
You have to find me
