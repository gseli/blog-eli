In love with love
It blinds me
Damn it
I love it

In love with love
The only one 
I’ve chased 
Despite how many times I’ve fallen

In love with love
What a crazy person I must be
It has no name to call upon
And no body to lay with me

In love with love
Touching the strings of my heart
Plucking them
Slowly One by one
